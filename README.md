# Major-Project
To make personalized product suggestions based on client usage patterns, recommendation 
systems use knowledge discovery techniques. Many e-commerce websites and online 
entertainment platforms use recommendation systems to predict recommendations and 
suggest things that customers may be interested in. 

The majority of recommendation algorithms begin by identifying a collection of users who 
have already made purchases and given ratings for similar things. The algorithm gathers 
products from these comparable consumers, filters out products the user has already bought 
or reviewed, and then suggests the products that are left to the user. Recommender systems 
are required to promptly provide high-quality suggestions, even for extremely large-scale 
problems, given the significant expansion of consumers and items in recent years.

In this project, we have developed a Hadoop-based application for product 
recommendation using collaborative filtering in Hadoop for big data. Hadoop executes 
distributed/multiple-node MapReduce algorithms, which provide us an edge compared to 
single-node algorithms in terms of scalability, accuracy, and better read performance.
